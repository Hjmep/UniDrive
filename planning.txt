Verifying App:
https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865
- during testing/development period, app doesn't need to be verified UNTIL it goes public
- when public/in production, need to add the production link as an "Authorized JavaScript origins" under credentials
- also, edit api key restrictions to include production link





Running the code
- Clone the repo
- make sure you have NPM installed
- run command "npm install"
- start the development server with "npm start"
